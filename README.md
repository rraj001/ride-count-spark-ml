- Every month, millions of people use bike-sharing systems to navigate cities and towns around the world. New York City's Citi Bike program launched in 2013 with 6,000 bikes, and in 2020, the system saw its 100 millionth ride. Citi Bike provides freely accessible data about its system operations that is both real-time and historical.

- Our ask is to predict the daily trip counts using Citi Bike data and other supporting datasets. For example, weather is an important factor affecting the daily trips in bike-sharing business, so we will be combining weather data with the Citi Bike data to get some important features for making predictions.
